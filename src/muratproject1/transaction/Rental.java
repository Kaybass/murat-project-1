/**
 * Each time a customer comes into the store, a Rental is created that will
 * keep track of what videos they rented and how many nights they will keep
 * the videos. A customer rents the "group" of videos and returns them all
 * at the same time. They will NOT, for example, rent three videos and then
 * return one after 2 days, the second after 5 days, and the third after
 * seven days. They will instead return all of the videos they rented at the
 * specified time. (That means, for instance, that a customer will never be
 * late in returning their videos.)
